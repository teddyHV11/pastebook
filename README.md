# Pastebook
A simple and configurable site to store your frequently copied and pasted stuff into neatly organised categories.

It has the following features:
* ðŸ‘¤ A simple registration system that does not collect any user data. Just gives the user a pastebook ID to manage their pastes.
* ðŸ“š A simple way to organise your pastes into categories, so that they can be easier to find.
* ðŸŒ± Shortcuts to make using the pastebook easier.

In order to self host follow these steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/teddyHV11/pastebook.git
cd pastebook
nano .env
npm i
npm start
```
Within .env you should add the following values.
```env 
allow_register=true

```
``allow_register`` defines wether the site should allow people to make new pastebooks/register.\
``idsize`` defines how large an ID of a pastebook should be.\
``maxaccounts`` defines how much accounts can be made from an IP per hour.\
``uses3`` defines if S3FS will be used for S3 connection to storage. (supports Cyclic at this moment only)
